# ReactMovieApp

My website is a movie website showcasing my work as a web developer with React and other modern technologies. React is a JavaScript library that allows me to build interactive and reusable user interfaces. With React, I can design simple views for each state of my application and render the correct components when data changes. This makes my code more predictable and easier to debug.

One of the features I like most about React is that I can use an XML-like syntax called JSX, which makes it easy for me to write interfaces with HTML and JavaScript. With JSX, I can create HTML elements with custom attributes and use JavaScript expressions within the HTML code. This gives me a lot of flexibility and clarity when creating my components.

To get the movie data, I use The Movie Database API (TMDB) with Axios, a JavaScript library that allows me to make HTTP requests easily and efficiently. Axios offers me several advantages, such as the ability to use promises, interceptors, cancellations and transformations in requests. To protect the security of my API access tokens, I use environment variables that I store in an env file that I do not share in the repository.

My web page consists of a showcase of movies where we can see their title, rating and score. These elements are React components that I can reuse in different parts of my interface. Each component has its own logic and internal state, which makes them encapsulated and independent. It also has a search engine that allows you to search for any movie registered in TMDB by entering the name or part of the name. The search engine uses a controlled component that updates the state of the text whenever the value of the input changes.

For styling, I use the CSS preprocessor Sass to better organize the CSS code and give it the hover effects that movies have. Sass allows me to use variables, functions, mixins and other features that make my code more readable and maintainable. I also use the vitejs module system to avoid conflicts with the css.

I am very proud of the final result of my website, as it demonstrates my skills as a web developer with React and other modern technologies. I think it's a good example to show in my portfolio and I hope you like it as much as I do.
